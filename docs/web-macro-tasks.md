## Web Macro Tasks

**Web Macro** tasks are designed to automate manual web browser actions and workflows where repetitive actions are performed.

Some tasks that can be automated by Web Macro tasks include:

- Form submission
- Data extraction
- Navigating across web pages

This process can be further automated by orchestrating the RPA task to run through an OpCon workflow.

### Web Macro - Actions Screen

The Web Macro Actions Screen is a central interface for designing and executing browser-based automation tasks. 

It allows users to record, edit, and run sequences of actions that mimic human interactions with websites. These actions are typically used to automate repetitive tasks such as logging in, scraping data, downloading files, and navigating web interfaces.

* **Record Mode**: Users can launch a recording session where every click, scroll, and input on a webpage is captured. A blue outline highlights selected elements, and the sequence of actions is logged in the right-hand panel.

* **Drag and Drop Mode**: Users can drag and drop desired actions from the left-hand panel into the sequence box in the right-hand panel.
