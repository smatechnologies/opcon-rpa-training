# OpCon RPA Training

The OpCon Robotic Process Automation (RPA) client is a powerful extension of the OpCon workload automation platform, designed to eliminate manual gaps and enable end-to-end automation across desktop, web, and hybrid environments. 

It allows users to record and replay UI-specific workflows such as keystrokes, mouse movements, and clicks on demand, automating tasks like data entry, file transfers, account management, and report generation.
